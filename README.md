# Urban-Self-Driving-Car

  ## Description :
     A self-driving car is a car that performs the driving task autonomously. It is capable of perceiving its environment, and planning its path in order to reach its destination. It incorporates an advanced control system that guides the vehicle along the planned path and helps it avoid obstacles and react to changes in the environment. 
  
  ## Goals:
     The main goal of this project is to implement an end-to-end self-driving car of third level autonomy by means of deep learning and convolutional neural network in order to be able to move around a track autonomously from a starting point till it reaches a goal point and to make its decisions in situations such as traffic lights, pedestrians, and other cars.The main platforms for developing, testing and collecting data for our model will be Udacity and Carla simulators.
